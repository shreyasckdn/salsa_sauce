Every restaurant undergoes regular health and hygiene inspections by government agencies in the United
States. The results of these health inspections are letter grades based on the amount of health code
violations issued. In certain cities, it is required for restaurants to post grade cards where they can easily
be seen by potential customers. In addition, previous inspection results are available online to the general
public. These inspection grades inform customers of restaurant hygiene and have shown to substantially
affect the revenue of businesses (e.g., Jin and Leslie (2005)).

In this project, we aim to predict the inspection grades of restaurants using data from previous
inspections. Moreover, various studies have shown that valuable insights into the hygiene status of a
restaurant can be gleaned from user reviews and ratings made about the restaurant on Yelp. Therefore, we
also aim to show that contemporaneous user reviews on Yelp can help predict the next inspection grade.
We believe that the resulting insight will benefit both restaurant owners as well as government agencies.
Based on our predictions, restaurant owners can proactively improve conditions of the restaurant, if
needed. Government agencies, on the other hand, can properly staff and prioritize their inspection
schedules based on our predictions.
